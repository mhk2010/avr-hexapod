# 2DOF Hexapod #

This project is the implementation of movement logic for 2DOF hexapod robot.

Full documentation page is available here: http://www.volny.cz/martin.metal/hp.html

The design is optimized for low end 8-bit microcontrollers. Atmel Mega8 @12MHz is used in the project. Construction uses 2DOF design. This limits the movement of the robot significantly compared with a 3DOF approach.
